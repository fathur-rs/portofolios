    descriptions:
      - Developed a system to digitize handwritten Indonesian medical prescriptions using OCR. Leveraged YOLOv10 to detect key elements (e.g., drug names, dosages) and TrOCR to convert handwritten text into digital format. Integrated open-source Llama 3.1 to generate easy-to-understand explanations of the prescription
      - This project supports the Indonesian prescription format and language, helping patients who struggle to read medical prescriptions due to lack of expertise or poor handwriting. It also aims to streamline healthcare workflows by automating the prescription review process, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in medical care
